"""WHEN DOES THE SUPERVISOR COME? Answered from evidence, not from faith.

Ported from the sibling project ALLIN1 (`backend/app/services/supervisor_rounds.py`,
read-only reference). Only the ASSUMED schedule differs: here it comes from
``SUPERVISOR_URGENT_MINUTE`` / ``SUPERVISOR_URGENT_EVERY_H`` so that the
countdown before the first observed knock matches this project's Routine
(`docs/supervisor/README.md`). Once knocks are recorded, the OBSERVED cadence
wins, exactly as before.


«وقتی دکمه فوری میزنم باید ناظر بگه چند دقیقه دیگه میره سراغش … هر دور دقیق به
ساعت محلی بسنجه و پیام بده» — the owner, 2026-09-30.

THE PROBLEM WITH THE OBVIOUS ANSWER
-----------------------------------
The urgent round is a scheduled Routine living in claude.ai, not in this repo.
The backend cannot read that schedule, so writing «hourly at :23» into the code
would be a number that is true only until someone edits the Routine — and a
countdown that is quietly wrong is worse than no countdown, because the owner
plans around it.

So the schedule is MEASURED. The round already knocks on this server every time
it runs (it claims the fast queue even when the queue is empty), which makes it
a heartbeat. From the last few knocks we can say when the next one is due, and
say so honestly:

    observed  — we have watched it and this is when it is next due
    assumed   — nothing watched yet; this is the configured default
    stale     — it has not knocked for several cycles; the Routine may be off

`stale` exists because «unmeasured» and «zero» must never look the same
(`experiences/a-monitor-must-distinguish-unmeasured-from-zero.md`). A silent
supervisor should read as «something is wrong», not as «about an hour».

Pure on purpose: it takes a clock and a list of timestamps and returns the
answer, so the whole thing is testable without a scheduler, a DB or a network.
